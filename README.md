# Java Entertainment

A simple app for managing series and films. 
Contains the functions : 
- Add new viewing (adds a series or a film after inquiring the user about details)
- Update viewing (edit a series object to alter its seasons or episodes)
- Search and rate (search for a film or series to rate, ask for user to log in before rating)
- Search for actor or director (search and add to favorites. Sign in required before adding to favorites)

Note that this application does NOT save anything added (users,viewings...), and everything added exists only for that specific run instance.
>Such a feature was not required by the assigment and thus was not developed.

*This application was developed for obejct oriented programming (1).*
